                <h3>Noble Oak</h3>
                <p>Ever been cruising through streets, reading a book, etc but can't seem to find the right music for the occasion? Shoot, I know I have! Don't worry though I got the tunes to flip that around. I want to introduce you guys to Noble Oak. A one man band whose sole member, Patrick Fiore, plays every single instrument. Let me tell you, this is one of the best albums I've heard in 2016. Hands down. Its the music that will fit any occasion wether you're cruising in the streets, doing that dreadful schoolwork, or just chilling to some dope vibes. This guy's music will have you hooked as soon as the album starts and will have you wanting to listen to it again as soon as it's over! Highly recommended! Check out his album "Past Life". You're in for a treat!

                <h3>Childish Gambino</h3>
                <p> IN CASE YOU MISSED IT!:<br>
I have been a fan of childish Gambino (aka Donald Glover) for long time, back when he was in the show 'community'.so naturally I'd be very interested in his music. Many people disregard him as being a true rapper, that's fine , but that's not the main reason why I got into him. I got into his music because of how progressive it was musically for the hip-hop genre. Sure his lyrics weren't always great, but he was creative in his song structure and musical ideas. Very experimental and weird. In his latest album "Awaken! My love!" He completely moves away from the rap genre and creates one of the most ambitious albums I've heard this year. He basically creates a 70's funk album, a damn good one at that, which harnesses back to the days when heavy fat bass and fuzzy guitar effects were the jam! This album is amazing in so many different ways. I highly recommend this album if you missed it, and if you're a fan of Gambino's music. If you're not, but are interested, check this album out and his previous albums "Camp" and "Because the internet".

                <h3>O'Brother</h3>
                <p> So mid 2016, I reached a music discovery drought. I could not find any music that could grab my attention for more than a minute. After going through a week without finding anything, I was slowly beginning to feel that no music could catch my attention! That is until I stumble onto this album. The album is 'dissolution' by "O'brother", and damn is this album awesome. It had everything I wanted at the time; experimental sounds, great lyrics, great song structure, I could keep on going on how great this album is. If you're interested in some very creative rock influenced music, check this album and these guys out now! Their music is definitely some of the best music I have heard in a very long time! <br>
                     P.s: Check out their newest release 'endless light' as well. Awesome album, an easy 9/10!

                <h3>Letlive</h3>
                <p>Listen up all fans of the post-hardcore genre. If you have not listened to the amazing band that "letlive."is, you are truly missing out on one of the genre's best acts right now. I first got into them through this album 'fake history'. This album has everything that a post-hardcore album should have! Awesome lyrics, heavy guitars, and some really great themes ranging from political ideals to personal issues. It also helps that front man Jason aalon Butler puts so much emotion and energy when he is singing, you can't help but be immersed in the songs and the lyrics. The instrument also compliment his voice amazingly. I'm telling you, if you have not checked this band out, do so now!
